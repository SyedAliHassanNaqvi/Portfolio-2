          I am a passionate web developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. Initially, I built projects like Tic-Tac-Toe,
          Rock-Paper-Scissors, and an Amazon clone to strengthen my skills. As I
          advanced, I expanded my expertise by learning frameworks like Tailwind
          CSS and libraries like React JS, which allowed me to take my projects
          to the next level.

          T With React and tools such as React Router, along with API
          integration, Iâ€™ve built optimized and dynamic applications. Some of my
          projects include a password generator, a sample website, and a
          currency converter that utilizes live API data.
